#summary An introduction to the textBe Build

= Introduction =

TextBe is built

  * From sources in SVN 
  * Using Tycho
  * On Jenkins
  * Deploying to Nexus OSS with P2 plugin

The project is split into 

  * The IDE frame application
  * User features to be installed into that frame

= Tycho requirements =

== Shared Namespace ==

Tycho uses the namespace that Maven uses. Eclipse has separate namespaces for 

  * features
  * plugins/bundles
  * products
  * targets
  * ..

To avoid namespace collisions, certain values for project names are currently reserved.

||*Tycho Type*||*Eclipse Type*||*Names*||
||eclipse-plugin||plugin||${projectName},${projectName}.unitTest,${projectName}.systemTest,${projectName}.branding,${projectName}.ui.help,${projectName}.api.help||
||feature||feature||${projectName}.sdk,${projectName}.rt,${projectName}.services,${projectName}.ui,${projectName}.sources,${projectName}.tests||
||repository||category||${projectName}.repository||
||repository||product||${projectName}.product||

== Version Numbering ==

In Maven -SNAPSHOT is a lesser version than the associated release version. In OSGI .qualifier is a greater version than the associated base version. This means that OSGI will select SNAPSHOT artifacts over RELEASE artifacts, which is not intended.

As a result the following rule is used

  * Even version numbers represent releases
  * Odd version numbers represent snapshots

= Features =

  * Features have a base name that is used to identify them within the repository. E.g. 'bt2gv'
  * Features are internally structured

||*extension*||*Long Name*||*provides*||*requires feature*||*includes feature*||
||services||Services||programmatic interface||none||none||
||ui||User Interface||interactive access||services||none||
||rt||Runtime||end-user features||none||ui,services||
||sources||Source Code||source code lookup||none||none||
||tests||Deployable tests||tests to run in test environment||test runners,target||rt||
||sdk||Source Developer Kit||everything except tests||none||
