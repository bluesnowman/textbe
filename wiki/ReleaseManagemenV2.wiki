#summary How TextBe is being released

=Releasing TextBE V2=

  * [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.branchmerge.commonpatterns.html All development happens on mainline]. There is no branching except for releases
  * The svn has a multi-project structure
  * There is a /p2 directory that contains the P2 repos

  # Create a branch of the module with the Release number (RN). This number is the version number of the parent POM.
    # For feature builds, this will determine the version number of the repository
    # For product builds, this will determine the version number of the repository and product
  # [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.ref.svn.c.lock.html Lock] the main line
  # Set the new version on the main line. The version numbering follows the even odd winding rule, due to the -SNAPSHOT inconsistency between MAVEN/TYCHO and OSGI. _Note: This should be revised for Tycho/Reproducible Version Qualifiers_
    # Release versions are even
    # Working versions are odd-SNAPSHOT (tycho) / odd.qualifier (osgi)
    # Use the interactive [http://www.eclipse.org/tycho/sitedocs/tycho-release/tycho-versions-plugin/set-version-mojo.html Tycho Set Version] Mojo to set the OSGI version from the parent project.
    # Use the interactive [http://www.eclipse.org/tycho/sitedocs/tycho-release/tycho-versions-plugin/update-pom-mojo.html Tycho Update POM] Mojo to make the POM version match the OSGI version.
  # Unlock the main line
  # Switch to the branch
  # Set the version number on
    # plugins (major, minor, micro)
    # Even versions for release, odd versions for snapshot/build qualifier
    # Features versions compute as upper limit of contained plugin versions
    # maven build
      # maven parent pom version is the release version
      # repository version is identical to the parent pom version
      # other versions are independent
  # builds should use -Dtycho.localArtifacts=ignore to ensure insulation
  # Run the build, verify results by testing (staging ok)
  # Check-in the branch.
  # Clean and check out again.
  # tag the build (move branch from branches to tags)
  # Check the repository created into P2/RN
